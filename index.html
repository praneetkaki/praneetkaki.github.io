                    and/or have real-world applications. Outside of school, I like to find ways to build on my academic knowledge, whether it is by reading articles about

                            at this time. I lead the New Jersey Chapter, which is made up of over 70 dedicated volunteers. We continue to form connections with 
                            high schools, libraries, volunteer organizations, and senior centers, expanding on our mission to connect with seniors. We have a
                            variety of events (Ex: jeopardy, trivia, music, 1-on-1 conversations) with many senior centers and a diverse volunteer base 
                            made up of students from across New Jersey. </p>

                        Martial Arts has not only helped me develop physically and mentally, but also played a huge role in molding me into the 
                        person I am today. I grew from a young, naive middle school kid into a young man with a true sense of discipline and 
                        the willpower to work hard and pursue any goal. Throughout my time at MPAMA, I have learned many valuable lessons from 
                        Master Peter and my other instructors: "CANEI (Constant and Never-Ending Improvement)", "Integrity is who you are when 
                        no one is watching", "Make yourself irreplaceable in a world where everyone is replaceable".
                        <br>
                             I started as a white belt - like any other student - I was able to work my way up the ranks as I developed as a 
                        student and a leader. After a few years as a student at MPAMA, I was invited to join the Special Winning Attitude Team  (SWAT) in 2016.
                        I trained and learned alongside a group of other high-achieving and motivated students and took on additional responsibilities
                        such as helping instructors during classes, whether it was by scanning the room during warm-ups and correcting mistakes or helping
                        teach curriculum to small groups of students who may be struggling. In 2018, I advanced from SWAT to the Leadership Team, which was
                        quite similar, but placed more emphasis on leadership and involved greater responsibilities when helping out with classes. 
                        <br>
                        In August 2019, I was chosen to become a part-time martial arts instructor at MPAMA, which would be my first job. As an instructor,
                        I attended more classes and was able to teach and lead entire classes of up to forty students. I was much more familiar with the 
                        forms, combinations, and techniques, so I was able to take on much more responsbility and effectively teach large groups of students. 
                        In addition to teaching, as an instructor, I was constantly teaching and embodying the core values of MPAMA such as integrity,
                        discipline, and respect.

                        and enjoy running in my free time to this day. Not only is it physically taxing, running is also mentally challenging. It has taught me 
                        that now matter how tired your body is, it is always possible to keep running as long as your mind is in the right place and has not
                        succumbed to physical discomfort. Running has truly helped me develop my mental fortitude that has paid dividends in several aspects of
                        my life.

                        My <i>favorite</i> sport, however, is definitely basketball. I play it quite often with my friends outside in my free 
                        time and watch the NBA on a regular basis. My favorite team is the Oklahoma City Thunder.
                        I have been an avid basketball fan for many years now (both playing and watching) and it remains my go-to way to
                        have fun. Aside from basketball, I also enjoy playing and watching football, soccer, and cricket.

                            Reading books and articles has not only allowed me to constantly acquire real-world knowledge outside of school, 
                            but also helped me develop important qualities such as patience, concentration, and curiosity.

                            My taste in books has definitely evolved over the years, going from mostly fiction/fantasy to 
                            predominantly nonfiction and practical selections. My favorite types of books to read are self-help
                            and medical-related books (although I do enjoy a thrilling dystopian novel here and there). Check out my

                            consistently throughout high school and continue to do so during college. Some of the organizations I have volunteered for in the past 
                            are The American Diabetes Association, Special Olympics New Jersey, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the American Cancer Society. 
                            I've mainly helped with events and fundraisers, whether it was by helping set up equipment, give out food, or run small venues/stations.

                            President of Horizon Networks NJ and oversee operations, I also consistently volunteer at events with seniors, whether it is by helping
                            trivia, jeopardy, or music activities, or simply by spending some time talking to the seniors and providing them with company. I recently joined
                            Stein Hospice as a volunteer, and it has definitely provided me with some of the most meaningful experiences. I help deliver birthday presents
                            to some of the hospice patients at their homes and spend some time talking with them and their families as they enjoy their gifts. I also visit
                            one of the patients frequently and spend some time talking to them at their home.
